## Description
This is a project called MyBlog, which was created as a hobby and had an educational purpose for me. In this project, I have coded the implementation of controllers, routes, models, views, sider and factory, and other important parts that can be used to raise a simple project.
In this project, I used a ready-made template that I downloaded from [this link](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-responsive-bootstrap-5-gaming-website-template-cyborg/), and sometimes the front-end may not be very desirable in some places, because the purpose of this project was to implement the back-end part.
